# Base_And_Report_For_Accounting_Documents
Base and report for accounting documents (Excel/Word/Python/Pandas)

At work, I often have fill out various reports of forms with a degree of state protection (without secret information ;) ).
Programmers are not ready to create databases and reports for all forms.
Therefore, as a practice, I decided to make such base in Excel and report in Word with Python and Pandas.
I chose Excel and Word on purpose so that an unprepared user could open it with a standard program and see the movement of forms or make changes to the report file.
Perhaps working with SQL-base would be easier in the direction of calculating and obtaining data, but as I mentioned above - Excel, Word and Panadas only due to the fact that other people (may) have to use the report.
Thus, I again saved time for filling out reports (10 minutes was, 1 minute was), I got new knowledge into practice in Python.
